# [Day 30 - Community resources and next steps](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/blogs/30daysmsgraph-day-30-community-resources-and-next-steps)

You may or may not know this but this project was almost entirely a labor of love and not the primary day job for many of our planners or contributors.  This series wouldn't have been possible without all the planners, content contributors, and you as readers.  A huge thank you to all for helping make this project a reality.  As we reflect on lessons learned, what went well, and what we can improve on for future projects we especially appreciate your feedback.  Please take a few minutes to share your feedback and suggestions on anything and everything related to this series as it helps make future projects like this possible.
